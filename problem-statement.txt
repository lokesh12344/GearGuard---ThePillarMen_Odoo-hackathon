# GearGuard: The Ultimate Maintenance Tracker

*(Odoo Module Specification)*

---

## 1. Module Overview

**Objective:**
Develop a maintenance management system that allows a company to track its assets (machines, vehicles, computers) and manage maintenance requests for those assets.

**Core Philosophy:**
The module must seamlessly connect:

* **Equipment** (what is broken),
* **Teams** (who fix it),
* **Requests** (the work to be done).

---

## 2. Key Functional Areas

### A. Equipment

The system serves as a central database for all company assets. Participants must create a robust **Equipment** record that tracks ownership and technical details.

**Equipment Tracking (use the search or group by for tracking the request):**

* **By Department:** (e.g., a CNC Machine belongs to the “Production” department)
* **By Employee:** (e.g., a Laptop belongs to “Person name”)

**Responsibility:**
Each equipment must have a dedicated **Maintenance Team** and a technician assigned to it by default.

**Key Fields:**

* Equipment Name & Serial Number
* Purchase Date & Warranty Information
* Location: Where is this machine physically located?

---

### B. Maintenance Team

The system must support multiple specialized teams.

**Team Fields & Logic:**

* **Team Name:** Ability to define teams (e.g., *Mechanics, Electricians, IT Support*)
* **Team Member Name:** Link specific users (Technicians) to these teams
* **Workflow Logic:** When a request is created for a specific team, only team members should pick it up

---

### C. Maintenance Request

This is the transactional part of the module. It handles the lifecycle of a repair job.

**Request Types:**

* **Corrective:** Unplanned repair (Breakdown)
* **Preventive:** Planned maintenance (Routine Checkup)

**Key Fields:**

* **Subject:** What is wrong? (e.g., “Leaking Oil”)
* **Equipment:** Which machine is affected?
* **Scheduled Date:** When should the work happen?
* **Duration:** How long did the repair take?

---

## 3. The Functional Workflow

Participants must implement the following business logic to make the module “alive”.

---

### Flow 1: The Breakdown

1. **Request:** Any user can create a request.
2. **Auto-Fill Logic:**
   When the user selects an **Equipment** (e.g., “Printer 01”):

   * The system should automatically fetch the **Equipment Category** and **Maintenance Team** from the equipment record and fill them into the request.
3. **Request State:** The request starts in the **New** stage.
4. **Assignment:** A manager or technician assigns themselves to the ticket.
5. **Execution:** The stage moves to **In Progress**.
6. **Completion:**
   The technician records the **Hours Spent (Duration)** and moves the stage to **Repaired**.

---

### Flow 2: The Routine Checkup

1. **Scheduling:** A manager creates a request with the type **Preventive**.
2. **Date Setting:** The user sets a **Scheduled Date** (e.g., next Monday).
3. **Visibility:**
   This request must appear on the **Calendar View** on the specific date so the technician knows they have a job to do.

---

## 4. User Interface & Views Requirements

To provide a good User Experience (UX), the following views are required:

---

### 1. The Maintenance Kanban Board

The primary workspace for technicians.

* **Group By:** Stages (New | In Progress | Repaired | Scrap)
* **Drag & Drop:** Users must be able to drag a card from “New” to “In Progress”
* **Visual Indicators:**

  * **Technician:** Show the avatar of the assigned user
  * **Status Color:** Display a red strip or text if the request is **Overdue**

---

### 2. The Calendar View

* Display all **Preventive** maintenance requests
* Allow users to click a date to schedule a new maintenance request

---

### 3. The Pivot / Graph Report (Optional / Advanced)

* A report showing the **Number of Requests per Team** or per **Equipment Category**

---

## 5. Required Automation & Smart Features

These features distinguish a basic form from a smart “Odoo-like” module.

### Smart Buttons

* On the **Equipment Form**, add a button labeled **“Maintenance”**
* **Function:**
  Clicking this button opens a list of all requests related **only** to that specific machine
* **Badge:**
  The button should display the count of open requests

---

### Scrap Logic

* If a request is moved to the **Scrap** stage, the system should logically indicate that the equipment is no longer usable
  (e.g., log a note or set a flag)
